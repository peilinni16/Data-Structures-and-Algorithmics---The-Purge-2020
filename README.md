# Data-Structures-and-Algorithmics---The-Purge-2020  

In order to reduce the number of crimes, the political regim called La Nova Fundació dels Pares d'Amèrica implemented a characteristic measure in front of the prevailing violence reigning in the streets: the `Annual Purge. Every year, for a series of days, any crime can be committed at night without having to answer to the law. The country has been organized into clans of citizens that are trying to survive.  

It is a game for four players, identified with numbers 0 to 3. Each player is controlled by a clan of warriors and builders. Each ́of them, which we will generally call 'civic', is born with a certain points of life.  

The game lasts a certain number of days, and each day starts with a number N of morning rounds, during which crimes are not allowed, and continues with N night rounds during which crimes are unpunished. There are elements of the game which have a different day and night behavior. In each round, each member of the clan can perform at most one action. As a result of these actions, clans can earn points. More specifically, points are awarded for collecting money or killing rival citizens. The winner of the game is the clan that gets more points.
